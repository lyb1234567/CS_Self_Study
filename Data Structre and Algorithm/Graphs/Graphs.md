## Graphs
A graph is a set of nodes that are connected to each other in the form of a network. First of all, weâ€™ll define the two basic components of a graph.

**Vertex**
A vertex is the most essential part of a graph. A collection of vertices forms a graph. In that sense, vertices are similar to linked list nodes.

**Edge**
An edge is the link between two vertices. It can be uni-directional or bi-directional depending on your graph. An edge can also have a cost associated with it (will be discussed in detail later).

# Trie Tree
This data structure is called a trie and is also known as a Prefix Tree. We will soon find out why.
The tree trie is derived from “retrieval.” As you can guess, the main purpose of using this structure is to provide fast retrieval. Tries are mostly used in dictionary word searches, search engine auto-suggestions, and IP routing as well.
